# Modeling of a Magnetorquer for Attitude Control and Stabilization of a 1U CubeSat Satellite.
To determine the physical parameters, model and mathematical representation of a magnetorquer. 

## Year: 2016.

# Margetorquer Design. 

## Modeling. 

To find a mathematical representation of the actuator and the related physical effects (electrical current, induction, magnetic torque and several more).

## Simulation. 

According the model obtained in previous pages, a simulation is viable, in which the design values are adequate for a 1U CubeSat.

## Other considerations. 

It is important to attend the physical properties of the design. For example, the material selection and geometry of electrical wire.
